                Here I would say something about my project, which was carefully designed at first, and become a trash at the end. <br>
                I was ambitious about the outcome. I spent days after days to try to make a double-gradient color picker feasible. <br>
                No similar code was available online; nothing was taught about it. I learned how to use canvas element and also use javascript to color it pixel by pixel;<br>
                I even define the algorithm on making a 4-cornered color gradient panel, which was far beyond my expertise;<br>
                <br><br>To select a color, you could adjust the slider first to set the gradient panel, and nextly, click on the panel to select a specific color;
                <br> After doing this, you would find that your color is evaluated and quantified in the second column.<br>
                If you feel good about the color, you could click either box in the cart to add the color to selection; <br>
                And when you wouldn't want that color, you can delete it by clicking its container.<br>
                This is also a problematic part - it seems that javascript is not so good at dealing with string comparisons. 
                I spent almost 14 hours on solving the unknown problem caused by it. It blindly judge my strings as equal when they belong to a same object, while judge them as different when they are stored in different boxes. 
                <br>Finally, I get rid of this simply by giving up comparing strings, but to compare the length of the strings. <br>
                Lastly, the final battle, and where I was actually defeated after all these tough success, was when I simply couldn't carry out image searching by color!<br>
                There are so many required packages that doesn't allow me to work it out without any plugins. However, if I get a plug-in, that doesn't actually help when others open the same webpage!<br>
                <br>Javascript does not serve well for all my ambitions. At first I thought I could take a detour and just utilize existing search engines, 
                and to do web scraping from the search result. <br> 
                But I was stopped because ajax get method couldn't work as it was blocked by the chrome!
                <br>Then I spent 6 hours on solving this problem, and I failed because all of the solutions require installation of new packages, application of different browsers, or even additional platforms. 
                <br>Finally, I knew that I couldn't make it at all. It was my biggest fault to naively thought that javascript could work with python on a webpage responsively. <br>
                If ever I knew this couldn't happen, I would never ever decide to do a project like this. 

                <br>Given that time is limited, and I have paid too much attention to this project which seemed didn't worth it at all(from the output), I have no choice but to give up and to describe everything I have to you. 

                <br>I really wished to make it perfect. I never thought it could be like this. 
                <br>Below are all the photos I collected, which couldn't be processed as color-dependent candidates. 
                <br>Above are all I did and all I could do within the time and energy limit. 
                <br>Thank you for your time and consideration.
